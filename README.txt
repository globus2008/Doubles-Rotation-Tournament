An alternative form of Doubles tennis tournament, where players enter each match with a different partner and in different positions.

== Description ==

**Doubles Rotation Tournament** (hereinafter **DoRoTo**) is a WordPress plugin designed to manage and organize tennis tournaments **in doubles**. With its advanced algorithms and user-friendly interface, the plugin offers a seamless way to schedule matches, rotate players, keep track of scores, and update standings in real-time.

**DoRoTo** is an alternative form of a doubles tennis tournament, where players enter each match with a different partner and in different positions (alternating left and right sides). This type of tournament stands out for its dynamism and social component, and thus can serve as a suitable environment for all doubles tournaments where different groups of players meet on the court.

The participants of the tournament change partners several times during the tournament by random selection and play against different pairs. The ratio of games won to games lost is calculated for each participant. The winner of the tournament is the player with this highest ratio. Such a player can best adapt to new circumstances and thus becomes an ideal teammate for doubles.

Whether you're a small tennis club or a large sports organization, the Doubles Rotation Tournament plugin offers a comprehensive solution for managing your doubles tennis tournaments efficiently and effectively. Its flexible design allows for customization, catering to the unique requirements of each tournament, while ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for all participants.

= Positives Doubles Rotating Tournament =

The DoRoTo provides a complete background for organizing a doubles tennis tournament, where, unlike a classic tournament:

* There is a rotation of teammates (DoRoTo tries, depending on the setup and the number of games, to play with everyone as much as possible, alternating the left and right sides of the court equally).
* An individual can enter the tournament without a teammate (thanks to rotation, you don't have a permanent partner anyway).
* The tournament can be organized even with an odd number of players and even with a minimum lineup of 4 players (this DoRoTo feature saves the tournament organizer a lot of trouble).
* DoRoTo allows you to define a special group of players for which special conditions can be set (if women are included in the special group, it can be set that only male+female pairs are drawn. Alternatively, male+male can be allowed but female+female prohibited. And vice versa (Similar combinations can be created in the relationship of parent + child or strong + weaker player).
* DoRoTo does not take place in the form of eliminations, so players are still in the game for the duration of the tournament and will play the same number of matches according to the settings.
* Usually shorter matches are played and thus more will be played during the tournament (or, on the contrary, shorter matches allow more players to participate).
* The tournament can be interrupted or extended in time at any time and it will not disrupt its progress in any way.
* Players can temporarily or permanently interrupt their game or enter the tournament in the middle, for example.
* It is not necessary for each player to play the same number of matches (the final ranking is determined only by the ratio of games won to games lost).
* DoRoTo perfectly provides an overview of the quality of individual players, where the quality of a teammate does not affect the rating due to the frequent change of partners.
* There is no downtime during the tournament waiting for a match to be played to move the tournament forward.
* At the end of DoRoTo, 2 categories of winners will be announced: the **Best player** of the tournament and the **Most ideal pair** of the tournament (theoretically, this pair could play together for the first time during the final match).
